        <p>${_("This is a Georgia Tech instance of the Open EdX Platform. It is part of the Course Lab for Education Technology Foundation course.")}</p>
        <p>${_("Open edX is the open source platform that powers edX courses. Open EdX platform is commited to the open source vision, edX code is freely available to the community. Institutions can host their own instances of Open edX and offer their own classes. Educators can extend the platform to build learning tools that precisely meet their needs. This is one such hosted instance of the Open EdX platform.")}</p>
        <h2>${_("Frequently Asked Questions")}</h2>
        <h3>${_("What is Open edX?")}</h3>
        <p>${_("The Open edX platform is a free--and open source--course management system (CMS) that was originally developed by edX. The Open edX platform is used all over the world to host Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as well as smaller classes and training modules.")}</p>
        <h3>${_("What is included in Open edX?")}</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>${_("Open edX Studio")}</p></li>
            <li><p>${_("The Open edX LMS (Learning Management System)")}</p></li>
            <li><p>${_("The capa_module XBlock, which implements a set of problem types that are based on LON-CAPA problem types")}</p></li>

        <h3>${_("What is Open edX Studio?")}</h3>
        <p>${_("Studio is the Open edX tool that you use to build your courses. You use Studio to create the course structure and then add course content, including problems, videos, and other resources for learners.")}</p>
        <p>${_("You also use Studio to manage the course schedule and the course team, set grading policies, publish each part of your course, and more.")}</p>
        <p>${_("You use Studio directly through a browser. You do not need any additional software.")}</p>
        <h3>${_("What is the Open edX LMS?")}</h3>
        <p>${_("The LMS is the Open edX tool that learners use to access course content, including videos, textbooks, and problems, and to check their progress in the course. The Open edX LMS can also offer a discussion forum and a wiki that both learners and course team members can contribute to.")}</p>
        <p>${_("For course team members, the LMS includes an Instructor Dashboard, with options to enroll learners, produce reports, and administer a course as it runs.")}</p>
        <p>${_("You use the LMS directly through a browser. You do not need any additional software.")}</p>
        <h3>${_("What is an XBlock?")}</h3>
        <p>${_("XBlock is the component architecture for the elements of an Open edX course. Software developers build XBlocks to create independent course components that work seamlessly with other components in an online course.")}</p>
        <p>${_("For example, you can build XBlocks to represent individual problems, or text strings, or HTML content. In addition, XBlocks are composable: you can build XBlocks to represent larger structures such as lessons, sections, and entire courses. By combining XBlocks that serve a wide variety of purposes, from delivering text and video content, to presenting multiple choice and numerical questions, to supporting sophisticated collaborative and interactive learning laboratories, course teams can create rich and engaging courseware.")}</p>
        <p>${_("A primary advantage to XBlocks is that they are deployable. The code that you write can be deployed in any instance of the edX Platform or other XBlock runtime application, and then used by any course team using that system.")}</p>
        <h3>${_("Where should I go for documentation?")}</h3>
        <p>${_("TODO: This section will contain links to the final tech documentation about using this instance of Open edX")}</p>
